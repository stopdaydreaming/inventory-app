Inventory Webapp Exercise
===

Using [create react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html),
please create a webapp that reads the provided `inventory.json` to display a
table that displays the inventory data & a chart that displays the counts of
the nodes in the inventory list separated by status. The webapp should also have
a form below the chart & table that can be used to add new nodes to the table &
chart widgets. (The webapp does not have to persist the change to the json file)

Please do not use a library for the data table. For the chart, our preference is
[chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) with
[react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2) but you are
welcome to use whichever charting library you prefer.


Note: The bar chart on the right should just be two bars counting how many nodes
are up and down
